      <h1>Why Hiring a Licensed & Insured Contractor Matters</h1>
      <p><em>Published July 27, 2025</em></p>

      <p>When it comes to hiring a contractor for your driveway, grading, or asphalt job, it’s tempting to focus only on the price. But before you sign anything or hand over a deposit, ask yourself one simple question:</p>

      <p><strong>Are they licensed and insured?</strong></p>

      <p>This isn’t just a box to check — it’s your protection. A licensed contractor is accountable, traceable, and has met basic state or county requirements to do the work. Insurance adds another layer of protection in case something goes wrong. If someone gets hurt or property is damaged, you don’t want to be the one left holding the bag.</p>

      <p>It also means you’re not dealing with a fly-by-night operation that disappears when the job falls apart.</p>

      <h2>How Can You Check a Contractor’s Credentials?</h2>
      <p>Yes — you can and should ask the contractor directly. But you can also verify their business license and insurance by checking with your local county office or Secretary of State website. For Georgia residents, <a href="https://ecorp.sos.ga.gov/BusinessSearch" target="_blank">this is a good place to start</a>.</p>

      <p>Some contractors will even list their license number on business cards or websites — but if they don’t, don’t be afraid to ask.</p>

      <h2>Why It Matters with Driveways & Asphalt</h2>
      <p>Driveways are not cheap — and neither are mistakes. If the grading is wrong, water can pool or cause erosion. If the base is thin or improperly compacted, cracks and potholes may form within months. Hiring someone with proper licensing ensures there’s someone to call when things don’t hold up — not a disconnected number and no paperwork.</p>

      <h2>What You Get With ProGrade & Asphalt</h2>
      <p>We carry an active business license and proper insurance to protect both you and our team.

If something we did needs to be corrected, you know exactly how to find us. We don’t run from our responsibilities — we finish what we start and stand behind every job.</p>

      <p>Hiring licensed and insured contractors is a smart move for any homeowner or business. It’s not about paying more — it’s about peace of mind.</p>
