      <h2>Choosing the Right Base: Gravel, GAB, Crush & Run — What’s Best for Your Driveway?</h2>
      <p><em>Published July 15, 2025</em></p>

      <p>Your driveway is only as good as the base underneath it. Whether you’re planning a gravel driveway or prepping for fresh asphalt, the foundation you choose will determine how long it lasts and how well it holds up to weather, traffic, and water flow.</p>

      <h3>#57 Stone</h3>
      <p>This is your typical clean gravel — no fine dust, just a mix of ¾” stone. It’s great for drainage but doesn’t lock together well. That means it's good for top layers but not ideal as a base unless mixed with something like screenings or GAB underneath.</p>

      <h3>GAB (Graded Aggregate Base)</h3>
      <p>The standard in Georgia for driveways going under asphalt. GAB is a mix of crushed stone and fine dust that compacts tight and stays locked in place. If you’re paving over it, you’ll want 4–6 inches of properly compacted GAB to ensure a strong subbase.</p>

      <h3>Crush & Run (Crusher Run)</h3>
      <p>A slightly rougher version of GAB with more chunks and loose fines. It compacts well and works fine for gravel driveways or temporary surfaces. But for a clean, finished look — or a surface you’re paving — GAB usually provides a smoother result.</p>

      <h3>Crushed Concrete</h3>
      <p>It’s cheap, strong, and often used as a base under asphalt. But if you’re leaving it exposed as a driveway surface, be warned: it creates dust, especially in summer heat, and won’t look clean for long. Good for under asphalt — not great for gravel-only driveways.</p>

      <h3>Asphalt Millings</h3>
      <p><strong>The Truth About Millings — Are They Worth It?</strong><br />
      Absolutely. Recycled asphalt, also known as asphalt millings, is a driveway option that’s growing in popularity — and for good reason. When installed and compacted correctly, millings can harden over time, reducing dust and even beginning to seal like fresh asphalt.<br />
      For the best results, a minimum of 4 inches is recommended — though 6 inches is ideal to achieve a smoother, longer-lasting finish. When installed by a professional with the right equipment and technique, millings can be a cost-effective and durable alternative to fresh asphalt.</p>

      <p>In short, your base material matters — and cutting corners here will cost you later. Ask your contractor what they’re using and why.</p>
