      <h2>Don’t Fall for the “Leftover Asphalt” Trick</h2>
      <p style="color: gray; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">Published: June 24, 2025</p>
      <p>
        It happens more often than people realize: a truck pulls up out of nowhere, and someone tells you they’ve got “extra asphalt” from another job and can give you a great deal. Sounds like a win, right? Not exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
        These types of scams have been going on for years. They target homeowners with aging or damaged driveways and offer what seems like a bargain. But here’s the reality:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>That “extra asphalt” may have been sitting in the truck bed for 4–6 hours, cooling down and losing its ability to bond and hold up.</li>
        <li>They promise to “grade and prep” your driveway but usually just scrape the surface and barely shape it.</li>
        <li>You’re told you’re getting 2 inches of asphalt, but in reality, it’s often less than ½ inch — just enough to look smooth for now.</li>
        <li>Once they finish and drive off, your new driveway might start falling apart within months.</li>
        <li>And when it does? Good luck finding them — the company name and number are usually gone by then.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A proper driveway requires real grading, compaction, and correct material thickness. If you're offered a “deal” on leftover asphalt with no prep work or contract, it’s a red flag. Cheap now often means costly later.
      </p>
      <p>
        At ProGrade & Asphalt, we do things the right way — no shortcuts, no surprises, and no tail light warranties.

      <p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong> Always hire a licensed and insured contractor — and ask for a written contract with material specs and expectations.</p>
