      <h2>Early Days</h2>
      <p>I started in 2002 as an apprentice in the Operating Engineers and began working under my dad on a paving crew. I started at the bottom, shoveling more asphalt than I care to remember — learning paving from the ground up and what it takes to provide a good product. I mastered the role of a shovel man and moved up to raking and fixing joints to ensure a seamless mat.</p>
      <p>Although I got occasional time on equipment, most of my experience came from hard work on the ground. Eventually, I worked my way up to rubber tire roller, then steel drum roller, and occasionally paver operator. They were long, hot days, but over the course of my three-year apprenticeship, I learned everything from groundwork to finished product. I became a full journeyman and continued my career for the next 10 years in Las Vegas, NV.</p>

      <h2>New Roots</h2>
      <p>In 2012, I moved to Georgia with my wife and four kids, following a rough economy and chasing a brighter future. I began working mid-2012 with a local asphalt business here in Georgia. After a year of paving, I began taking on small grading jobs — prepping sites for asphalt. It wasn’t long before grading became my main focus.</p>
      <p>I taught myself how to run a motor grader and started completing full jobs solo. Within my second year, I was working full-time as a grader and eventually became one of four grading foremen. I stayed with that company until 2025, building experience, respect, and a reputation for getting it right the first time.</p>

      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>I launched ProGrade & Asphalt in 2025 with a mission to build from a small family-owned business into a trusted and competitive name in grading and paving. I want to create something my family and I can be proud of — something that can grow with us and be passed on for generations.</p>
      <blockquote>“I pride myself on being honest and fair — no cutting corners.”</blockquote>
      <p>From driveways to commercial lots, we treat every job like it matters — because it does.</p>
